## Introduction

SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, has revolutionized space exploration with its reusable rocket technology. This project aims to analyze SpaceX rocket launches and predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Data Collection

Data is collected from various sources, including APIs, web scraping. The collected data includes launch details, payload information, outcomes, and more.

## Data Wrangling

The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. This involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the SpaceX launch data.

This includes analysis using SQL and Pandas, Visulization with Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Key metrics such as success rates, launch site distributions, and payload characteristics are examined.

## Interactive Visualization

Interactive visualizations are created using tools like Folium to provide dynamic maps showing launch locations, landing sites, and other geographical information. This enhances the exploration of SpaceX missions with interactive features.

## Dashboard

A dashboard is developed using Dash, a Python web application framework, to present key findings and insights from the analysis. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the data and explore various aspects of SpaceX rocket launches.

## Machine Learning Prediction

A machine learning pipeline is implemented to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings. This involves feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model.
